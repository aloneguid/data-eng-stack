# Data Engineering Stack

Minimalistic data engineer's stack for local Spark development. Inspired by [this project](https://github.com/cluster-apps-on-docker/spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker).

Goals:
- Minimalistic. One small image containing different workloads.
- Supports external IDEs (JetBrains, VSCode, etc.)
- Easy to upgrade.
